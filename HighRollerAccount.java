	// A high roller account has all the behaviors and properties of a basic account,
	// but a zero maintenance fee is collected from a high roller account
	// and when interest is added, it is added twice: 
	// e.g balance 100, intRate = 0.1 => 110 (from first interest added) => 121 (from second interest added)
	
	public HighRollerAccount(int id, Person owner, String bank, double balance) {
		// your code here
	}
	
	// your code here
	
	// override the toString method to return: "High Roller " + whatever the basic account returns
	// your code here
